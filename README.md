# vesti

A transpiler that compiles into LaTeX

I am making a new syntax for vesti, and the source code about that is in the new repository.
If you want to use that one right now, then install this by compiling the source code.
If not, then wait until it is fully impliemented.

New version might be implemented in C langauge.

## But Why C instead Rust?
This is my toy project.
