# vesti

A toy project which is a preprocessor that is compiled to latex code
This program is in beta, so do not use this program in real projects, yet.

# TODO to upgrade to v0.2.0
- [x] Well-orgarized error module. (current version is somewhat bad)

# TODO to upgrade to v0.3.0
- [x] Fix memory leaking when vesti is closed with error. (in the current version, it uses process::exit to exit the program)

# TODO to upgrade to v0.4.0
- [x] Add fraction syntax
- [ ] Add matrix syntax
